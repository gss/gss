The GSS engine processes parsed GSS constraints, solves them using [Cassowary](/docs/cassowary), and updates CSS accordingly.

## Usage

This CCSS expression says that two buttons should have the same width:

```
#button1[w] == #button2[w]
```

Using the [GSS compiler](https://github.com/the-gss/compiler), this is translated to the following AST:

```
{
  "selectors": ["#button1", "#button2"],
  "vars": [
    ["var", "#button1[w]", "w", ["$id", "#button1"]],
    ["var", "#button2[w]", "w", ["$id", "#button2"]]
  ],
  "constraints": [
    ["eq",
      ["get", "#button1[w]"],
      ["get", "#button2[w]"]
    ]
  ]
}
```

This AST can then be passed to the GSS engine. The GSS engine will measure the existing dimensions of the DOM elements, and initialize a Cassowary Web Worker to solve the optimal width for both of the buttons to match the given constraint.

```
// Load the GSS engine CommonJS module
var Engine = require('gss-engine');
// Instantiate the GSS engine by giving it a path to the Cassowary Solver Web Worker
var gss = new Engine('/some/path/to/gss-solver.js');

// Run the engine with the AST above
gss.run(ast);
```

After the proper values have been solved, the engine will modify the CSS values in DOM accordingly.

## Supported dimensions

Each instance of the GSS engine is run for a given DOM container. If no container is provided, the GSS engine will fall back to the [document object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document).

Constraints are given by using various dimensions of elements. The elements are chosen using standard [CSS selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started/Selectors).

The currently supported dimensions of an element are:

* `width` (shorthand: `w`)
* `left` (shorthand: `x`)
* `right` *read-only*
* `centerX` *read-only*
* `height` (shorthand: `h`)
* `top` (shorthand: `y`)
* `bottom` *read-only*
* `centerY` *read-only*
